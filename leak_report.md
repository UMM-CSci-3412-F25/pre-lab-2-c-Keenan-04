# Leak report

Memory leaks happen because when a program is allocated a sum of memory and is never freed of that memory.
This also means that we have to free the memory during the running program or through some other means.
Memory leaks also happen when a pointer changes during a program and doesn't free that meaning that the memory being used is now lost and isn't in use anymore.
